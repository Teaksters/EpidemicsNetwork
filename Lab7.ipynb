    "Compared to the Erdos-Reyni network this curve starts more steep and a lot of infections happen in the first 60-70 timesteps. Then the curve gets less and less steep and the infection speed slows down a lot. This is because in a scale-free network instead of the degree of each node being uniformely distributed with a chance p, now there are less hubs with a lot of connections which normally would not exist in a Erdos-Reyni network (or at least have a very small chance of existing). Additionally all the other nodes on average have a lower degree. Thus the infection spreads quickly, or rather explodes in the beginning once it has reached the main 'hubs' which spread it very fast. Then it slows down as all the nodes connected to the hubs are infected, but all nodes without connections to those hubs with a small degree and no connection still need to be reached. "

    "Based on the figure gotten from 4 c), it is visible that nodes with a high degree are most likely to be infected first, the nodes with lower degrees have less neighbors that can infect them. So will have a lower chance to be infected. This explains why the average degree of infected nodes starts high and sinks lower and lower (fairly quickly) and stays low for most of the as the more connected nodes are infected already and the less connected nodes are the only ones left, yet very hard to infect."
